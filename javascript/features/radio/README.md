# Radio feature
Grand Theft Auto certainly has a good reputation when it comes to the game's music, having various
radio channels featuring many different kinds of music.

However, after playing the game for a few hundred hours, it becomes repetitive. We therefore offer
players the ability to listen to streams of radio channels as opposed to the default in-game music.

These streams can be listened to while in a car, or while in certain areas of the map such as on
the pirate ship. The channel selection is available in [/data/radio.json](a JSON file).
