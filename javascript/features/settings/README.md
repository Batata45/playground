# Settings
There are a lot of settings that influence Las Venturas Playground's gamemode. In many cases it is
convenient for Management members to be able to update these in real time, without requiring a
restart of the server.

The Settings feature provides exactly this. Lists of categorized options of various data types that
have default values, can be updated and can be observed. Non-default values will be stored in the
database so that they can be reapplied after a server restart.

The [Playground](../playground) feature provides an `/lvp settings` command that enables Management
to update these settings whenever they deem it appropriate.
