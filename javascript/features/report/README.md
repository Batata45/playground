# Feature: Report
We like to keep the server clean from hackers, cheaters, etc. To give the players the ability to
help with this we provide the report-feature for it. Via this feature players can report players to
the administrators in-game and on IRC. On this way administrators can take a look to it and decide
what to do.

## Commands
The following commands are available as part of the feature:

  - **/report [reportedPlayer] [reason]**: Reports the give in-game player with the specified reason to
    administators.

## Features
The following features are enabled for those maintaining a list of friends:

  - **What did they type?**: Since the [player]-parameter relies on partial matching, we show the
    player who is reporting someone the reported player and given reason.
