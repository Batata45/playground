# Feature: Player favours
A lof of the Las Venturas Playground administrators and players are fantastic people who have spent
hundreds, if not thousands of hours improving the community. For such players, occasionally, we
develop small bits of functionality specific to their likings.

## Joe's Garage
[Joe](https://sa-mp.nl/players/30/joe.html) is keen to transform a certain interior in the main
world as his house, but a number of rubbish and shelf objects are obstructing his line of vehicles.
These default objects will now be removed for all connecting players.
