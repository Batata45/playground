# Feature: Gangs
A gang is a group of players that have declared an alliance and fight together for their common
benefit. They enjoy several unique features on Las Venturas Playground, many of which are
implemented in this feature.

**Vastly incomplete TODO list**
  - Define the database model for gangs.
  - Define the commands used to create, delete and modify gangs.
  - Store gang information in the database, load on player connection.
  - Create a gang bank account.
  - Create a gang chatting channel.

**Open questions**
  - Do we still want to enable temporary gangs?
  - Should administrators be able to join any gang they please?
