# Management Commands
This feature defines a series of commands available to Management members. Other players can be
given temporary access to these commands as well, through the `/mallow` and `/mdeny` commands. Usage
of these commands is only logged to the server logs, not to anyone in-game or on IRC.

  - **/mallow**: Lists the players on the temporary access list.
  - **/mallow [player]**: Allows `player` to use the management commands during this session.
  - **/mdeny [player]**: Revokes the access for `player` to use these commands.

The following regular commands are available as part of this feature:

  - **/boost [player] [factor]**: Boosts the velocity of `player`'s vehicle by `factor`.
