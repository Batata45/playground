# Component: Feature Manager
The feature manager component provides a registry of all [features](../../features/) available in
the JavaScript implementation of Las Venturas Playground.

You are not supposed to create your own FeatureManager instance. Instead, use the instance available
on the global [Playground](../../playground.js) instance: `playground.featureManager()`.
