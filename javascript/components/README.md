# Components
Components are smaller collections of functionality that translate an in-game concept to a idiomatic
and convenient interface for usage in JavaScript. They avoid much of the limitations and complexity
found in Pawn scripts, due to JavaScript's dynamic nature.

Components should be well documented, and, ideally, tested, given that they provide common
functionality that may be used by several features.
